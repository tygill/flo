Planning and design for flo, the simple web server for CS 360.

The purpose of this little server is to implement a simple subset of the HTTP protocol, specifically for CS 360 at BYU. As such, the code quality is not quite perfect, as much of it is not planned on being used for other purposes once the class is done. For this reason, rather than use char* to store socket data, the slightly less runtime efficient std::string class is used instead, because its more readable and easier to code. Additionally, there are liberal uses of the std::string::append() function, rather than using some sort of string builder class. Again, I admit these, but the purposes of the project lead me to build it this way.

To compile under linux (Windows would require some compatability headers that I haven't looked for yet), create a new directory and from within it, use the command:
cmake ..
where .. is the path from the new directory to the root directory of flo. Then simply use the
make
and
./flo
commands to make and start flo respectively. It runs on port 10042, and should be accessable by most modern browsers.
